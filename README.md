PSOS Examples

- Examples tested with an [ESP8266 with 4MB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073CQVFLK) (a WebMOS D1 Mini clone) and [ESP32](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QCP2451)
- At future date may also test with Pico W and Pico with an ESP8266 coprocessor
- Does not cover installing micropython. For that, see instructions for [ESP8266](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/quickref.html) and [ESP32](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp32/tutorial/intro.html)
- Uses the micropython [`uasyncio` for multitasking](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/uasyncio.html)
    - will cover some of the basics later starting in example ??? 
- Uses Thonny IDE and [HiveMQ Web Client](http://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/?)
- [Random Nerd Tutorials](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/projects-esp32-esp8266-micropython/) contains detailed instructions on how to install Thonny IDE and as well as how to flash micropython onto either device
- This is based on MQTT. Should be familiar with that. If not, Random Nerd Tutorials has an excellent [introducton to MQTT](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/what-is-mqtt-and-how-it-works/)
- Uses [HiveMQ](hive mq link here) in particular. They have an [open public MQTT broker](https://www.hivemq.com/public-mqtt-broker/) and provide [free private MQTT accounts](https://www.hivemq.com/downloads/) that allows you to connect up to 100 clients at a time
